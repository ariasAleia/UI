# User Interface. Proof of Concept

In this repository is the PoC of the user interface made for the subject Applied Engineering Project. 

The main purpose is to make quick tests of each of the states of the state machine that will communicate with the peripherals of the device to be developed: LCD and buttons. 

Disclaimer: This is totally anti pythonic way. The final program was designed using concurrent programming in embebbed C for a Raspberry Pi Pico

The initial tests are performed by printing the messages on the terminal and simulating the behavior of the buttons with keyboard inputs.
